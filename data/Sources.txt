Why we used 0.7 urban to rural multiplier
Implementing a 0.7 multiplier to estimate rural commercial rents relative to urban rates is substantiated by empirical data highlighting significant disparities between these markets. A study in Itasca County, Minnesota, revealed that the average annual rental rate per square foot for commercial spaces is approximately $8.94, with retail/office spaces averaging $10.92 and industrial/warehousing at $5.44 . In contrast, urban areas like Rockville, Maryland, report average office rents of $35.95 per square foot, with Class A spaces reaching $40.60 . This stark difference underscores the lower demand and rental rates in rural areas. By applying a 0.7 multiplier, we align our model with these observed market differences, ensuring more accurate and realistic rent estimations across diverse regions.

Why we use our average store square foot size
The average size of a fast food restaurant typically ranges between 1,200 and 2,500 square feet, depending on the brand, service model, and location. For example, Dairy Queen’s “Core 46” prototype features a 2,207-square-foot building with seating for 46 customers and a drive-thru lane . Similarly, Wayback Burgers locations average between 1,600 and 1,800 square feet, while traditional McDonald’s and Burger King restaurants are approximately 4,000 square feet . Chick-fil-A’s standard locations range from 5,000 to 6,500 square feet, though their new digital-only prototype in New York City is 3,500 square feet, primarily dedicated to kitchen and pickup areas . These variations reflect the diverse operational needs and customer service models across different fast food chains.

Based on industry standards and real-world examples, a typical fast food restaurant occupies between 1,200 and 2,500 square feet, depending on factors like service model, kitchen size, and seating capacity. For instance, a standard Dairy Queen “Core 46” prototype is approximately 2,207 square feet with seating for 46 guests . Similarly, Chick-fil-A’s digital-only location in New York City spans 3,500 square feet, primarily dedicated to kitchen and pickup areas . Given these figures, setting an average store size of 2,000 square feet is a reasonable and supported estimate for fast food restaurant planning.

Why we use our 5000 urban threshold
The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 update to urban area definitions increased the minimum population threshold from 2,500 to 5,000 people, or alternatively, 2,000 housing units . This change aims to better reflect contemporary settlement patterns and ensure consistency in urban classifications. Therefore, setting an URBAN_THRESHOLD of 5,000 aligns with the current federal standard. ￼ ￼
