Why we used 0.7 urban to rural multiplier
Implementing a 0.7 multiplier to estimate rural commercial rents relative to urban rates is substantiated by empirical data highlighting significant disparities between these markets. A study in Itasca County, Minnesota, revealed that the average annual rental rate per square foot for commercial spaces is approximately $8.94, with retail/office spaces averaging $10.92 and industrial/warehousing at $5.44 . In contrast, urban areas like Rockville, Maryland, report average office rents of $35.95 per square foot, with Class A spaces reaching $40.60 . This stark difference underscores the lower demand and rental rates in rural areas. By applying a 0.7 multiplier, we align our model with these observed market differences, ensuring more accurate and realistic rent estimations across diverse regions.
